# Raw Notes 
1. 30 minute resume tailoring for each to match ATS - too time consuming for all jobs ... 
2. Wanted way to automatically get relevant jobs since job search filters are very simple (not semantic understanding) and also track which jobs she applied to, since she spent so much time doing that herself 
3. Annoyed missing jobs because openings closed 10 hours after posting
4. Spent full time applying for and interviewing at companies 
5. 70% response rate 
6. Couldn't trust Chat GTP to tailor as it would make stuff up and worried she'd get called out in the interview 
7. Spent $20 on a resume grader tool
