- ~25 year old Software Developer 
- Working at GM? 
- Desires: 
    - New job
    - Better Pay 
    - Enhance technical skills 
- Problems:     
    - Searching job is very time consuming, cannot balance with own job 
    - Balancing finding jobs vs. preparing for technical interview 
    - Doesn't track in detail work she does at work, making referencing in job process harder 
- Process: 
    - Manually find/apply to 3-5 jobs a day (20-40% of time) 
    - Send connections to people at company / maintain communication with them 
        - Large time spent maintaining these connections 
    - 90% sending the same resume to all jobs         
    - Compiling list of all stuff she does at work for future reference 



# Raw Notes 
Wants move Seattle 
And gap in between 

Semi actively looking 

Challenge s- full time job looking for other job 
Keep track of all contacts 
Interview prep 
Can get interviews by reaching out to… 
But can do that or interview prep … 

Once in Seattle, full time job search 

Then imagine interview prep for different types of interviews 

They might look for fundamentals data structure algorithm questions but then they might pull website and you need to figure out way to put in a feature they request 

Need figure out how to juggle between reaching out to get interviews, and actually preparing for those interviews 

How normally prepare for interviews 
- Ask recruiter for prep / info on interview structure 
- Data structure or algorithm 
- If they say leetcode then practice on leetcode 
- If else, then she looks at their tech stack for react syntax 

Applying / Searching for interviews 
- Applying for 3-5 jobs a day 
- Then make sure send connections to all people in the company 
- And respond back to the people you reached out to 
    - If apply, and then on LinkedIN see if anybody posted about the job … or just look for people who work at the same company at engineering and send them connections 
    - If it’s recruiter or engeinerring manager, then will send message are you hiring or anybody hiring for this role (I applied to) I would love to chat
    - Or if fellow engineer and ask for time, and want to learn more what you do 
- Mostly of the time responding and meeting with people at LInkedIn 
- So many ways to look for job postings etc. 
- Making sure I followup - it could take week or more for response 
    - Forgets context on why she sent sometimes … 
- 20-40% is applying and the rest is LInkedIn 
- Why LinkedIn 
    - Sometimes it does lead to connections ith people who are hiring 
    - Sometimes it could be avisiblity thing 
        - Current job, she was in school, and reached out to recruiter, and she didn’t respond, accepted conection request, sent messages but it went well int he end … 
        - And the job was from her … ? 
- Thinks gets response if somebody from job accepts the oconnection request and it leads to interview … 
    - Recruiter outreach / linkedIN interactions 
- Main issue is time spent here … 
- 90% sending the same resume 
    - Thought about tailoring the resume? 
    - Unsure how much it will help … 

What is goal in new job? 
- Either go into traditional developed software company to enhance technical skills or go to startup with many hats
- Technical skills … ? Want more better compensation, very important and want to move to Seattle leading motivator 



Think brought up really good problem 
Didn’t check respond rate for big tech companies 
Probably not very well …. 
Tool aimed at process very rigorous 

Quick input: 
- Missing data points come from me tracking my work at work … 
- After every sprint write down what I did
- And put it in the performance tracker 
- Started compiling list of all the stuff she’s done and put it into the resume
