## Initial Business Approach
Following the guidance from Nicolas' notes, we'll start with a lean approach:
- Focus on a specific niche first (e.g., software developers or product managers)
- Build the MVP that solves the core pain point (resume tailoring without hallucinations)
- Gather 10-100 dedicated early users who love the product
- Do unscalable things initially (e.g., manual review of AI outputs if needed)
- Use early user feedback to refine the product before scaling
- Test different pricing models with early users to find the optimal approach
