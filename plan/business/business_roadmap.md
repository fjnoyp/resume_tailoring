## Learning & Adaptation Framework
Following the Build-Measure-Learn methodology from Nicolas' notes:

1. Each development cycle will include specific learning objectives
2. All features will have defined success metrics
3. Regular user feedback sessions will guide product evolution
4. Willingness to pivot based on market signals and user needs
5. Monthly strategy reviews to adjust roadmap as needed

This roadmap will be treated as a living document, updated regularly based on market feedback, user needs, and emerging opportunities. The focus remains on building something people truly want rather than adhering rigidly to a predetermined plan.
