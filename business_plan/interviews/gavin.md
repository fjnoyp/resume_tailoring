New role / experiences / location (SF, Seattle) wants to do another city

Starting last month started applying did 3 cycles of job apps

Process:

2020 (covid)

1. cold applying / contacted alumni for referrals

- got some interviews
- lots of larger ones followed up ...

2021 2. reached out to product managers etc. did calls -> got interviews for APM
google, lyft, meta

- final round for Google/Lyft, pulled out for school
- networking calls? -> got interviews that way ...
  - eph link, internal linked in for Williams for students
  - can reach out to alumni who sign up for that
  - newer grads use it

2025

- started last month
- reaching out to alumni - a lot in his years .. 2018-2023 are all in early
  stage networking with alumni ...
- reached out to williams alumni managers / senior managers
- likes talking to younger folks and lot to learn
- when networked with older alumin, they would forward resume directly to the
  recruiters, because they're higher up the recruiters followup immediately,
  lots of luck
  - pretty surprised ...
  - normally found through LinkedIn / Williams CS network ... instagram/text
    because aware of each other, tangentially related from campus etc.
  - 50/year graduating in CS

Would polish resume to the best of his ability .. for the ATS system ... There
were a lot of jobs that asked for 5+ years etc. / docker, mysql Resume wouldn't
pass lots of ATS things unless AWS was their target Why have ATS skip through
me, why not have internal person to surface my resume to a human pair of eyes
...

- that's been working fro him pretty well, going trhough Williams contacts at a
  company
- targeting 500 sized people, where managers are directly in touch with HR
  folks, vs. larger larger tech companies
