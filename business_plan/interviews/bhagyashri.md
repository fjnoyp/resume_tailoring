Very stressful finding new job 

have to apply a lot of jobs to just hear back from a couple 

mostly speaking with recruiting companies that place candidates 

not even talking with the company itself ...

technical screens are really difficult, expectations are so high 
has problem with coding under pressure 

Process

1. LinkedIn - not using other platforms yet - applies there 
Keeps profile updated 
When posting updates you get views from recruiters, more activity on LinkedIn the algorithm will boost your proile she thinks - reposting content and recruiter reaching out 
- Doesn't post too much, like a python line, one liners, something related to coding, but without going too crazy 
- Posts about Fluent React book insights 
- Posts about Capstone project she built 
(professional tweets) 
Time spent: 1 post a week 

Thinks any activity (adding new skill / skill section) helps with search visibility as recruiters search by skills ... 

Feature - can let recruiters know you're looking for a job - activated that ... (helped a bit as well) 

Startups are trying to get FAANG candidates ... 200k targeting people laid off from FAANG (sees that in the job postings) 

Thinks that is reason when she applies she doesn't hear back from these companies ...

2. Just using LinkedIn Jobs 
- just using her resume (does not tailor) 
thinking about building a website, could help with showcase those things as job application might not do good job presenting ... 

Had idea to upload resume to a chatbot (just thought about that last night) .... to ask for their feedback ...

How long seearching job - 6-8 months 

Responser ate - is super low 50 jobs to 2 people .... 

Resume tailoring thoughts? -> made several updates to her resume ... especially for the summary part 
- continously updates her resume based on her job updates at her current job 

How much time spent tweaking resume? Did 5 updates lately, everytime took an hour to perfect the wording and layout 

3. How is time allocated for all job search process

(NOTE ->) 
- application process -> spent 4 hours applying to a lot of jobs, couldn't count how many jobs she applied to - since job apps were asking about PAST EXPERIENCE, WHY WORK, like a interactive cover letter 

- Need to talk about projects, and how it relates to job applying for, etc. - each application can take 15 minutes ->
(NOTE ->) 
AI - concerned AI generated text is easy to be found out ... 
- can be too perfect, also says some applications saying don't use AI 
-> for any technical coding related questions uses Anthropic for everything else using Gemini (Anthropic is too boilerplate)





(seems to be going for breadth rather than depth) 

- But response rate is super low each time .. most time never hear back, nothing is replied, just doens't even know if the company is hiring or not 

- Interview with Coinbase - second call was a technical screen simple react app - you could not use multi monitors, cannot open different tabs ... had a bunch of tests written. 


Average Week 
- 2-3 days 
- 3 hours a week 
- Each applyign session is at least 1-4 hours 
- Just applying on LinkedIn, responding to recruiters, talking to 3 recruiters 30 minutes each ... 
- not replying to many people due to lack of responses so far though ... 

- thinks using a tool is good, but doesn't know which tool to use, figuring out a new thing feeling resistance 


Thoughts: 
really confused that she qualifies for jobs she applies to 
even though asking for multiple js frameworks, genai, etc. she has all the skills they are asking for, don't undersatnd why not getting the responses
wasn't this hard 1-2 years ago 

feels like remote jobs are going away ... another challenge, in philly not a huge market, remote jobs are more competitive

(Note->) 
best applicaton of ai, find her skills and see what she can offer and find all the jobs to auto apply to ...
