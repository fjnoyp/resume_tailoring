# Shideh 

- ~45 year old Software Executive 
- Desires: 
    - New job in senior director IT, chief operating officer, program/project management 
- Problems: 
    - Cannot get AI to properly tailor resume/cover letter
        - hallucinations 
        - logical errors in experiences 
            - mentions wrong technologies, applies wrong technologies to the job, experience issues that experts would catch 
        - rewrites 40-50% of ai resume output (4-6 hours each time) 
    - Tedious process to keep track of jobs applied to 
    - Difficult to cram 20 years of experience into 2 pages and relating it to each job description  
    - Existing resume tools (like Teal) are "garbage" - cannot rewrite resumes correctly 
    - Rewriting resume / cover letter is most painful part - actually applying is quick 
- Process: 
    - Tried to use Excel to scrape page and update excel sheet of jobs (failed) 
    - Tried to use AI low code solutions to tailor resume with multi step nodes - recruiter, resume analyzer, etc. 
- Ask: 
    - Describe job, ai searches all websites, updates central database, tailors resume/cover letter for each 




# Raw Notes 
IT operation executive - application / inrastrcuture / networking security 

Love application development - implementing SaaS applications AI or SaaS 

Care less about networking 

Senior director of IT, VP of IT, Chief Operating Officer, 20 years of program and project management IT and Engineering 

Problem: trying get information from LinkedIn, building AI application to help herself, try save jobs on LinkedIn but cannot download them, 

use ChatGPT scrape page by page and download to excel 
Then keep track I am applynig

1. finding jobs 
2. then want job in a table to change status whether applied, need to resume and cover letter no more than 2 pages, ATS friendly 
	1. built a crew ai application - want intelligent ai with job description and my resume you analyze the gaps and write in an ATS friendly
	2. ATS friendly approver 
	3. Act like recruiter, and try to analyze 
	4. then if good, send me email wtih markdown 
	5. then do process until you get approval from both approvers 

Would love to see it similar approach 

(!) Issue - hallucination - it will make things up, or write experiences that don't make sense, part of the statement is incorrect, the wrong technology is being mentinoed, expert would notice it though ... - need to constantly read and rewrite it ... 

Wants a 2 page resume (original was 4 pages) -> 2-3 page max ... 2 page misses lots of information ... 

Critical every statement is related to everything related and mapping to the job description ... 

2 pages issue - if I wanted to apply to a different role, have to start to scratch again ... 

Like IT role vs Program Management Role ... 

Wrote a custom GPT - one for cover letter, one for writing resume, and writing resume reads the resume then reads job description and comes up with gaps, then rewrites based on the gaps, but when it rewrites, you have to go back and forth ... maybe 40-50% then have to rewrite again ... 

Takes 4-6 hours per resume ... 

Started with ChatGPT then used CrewAI, maybe with agents for rewriting the resume that reads job description and rewrites the resume then review process ATS and Recruiter approver, but hoped it would worked. 

- hallucination still... 
- statements that were not correct .... 

Custom GPT doesn't have memory 

Applygin senior director of IT ... it provided (she will provide samples) 
- say it director but then the technology it was using was completely wrong ...
- would say ai then say technology that is not ai ... 


She can -> 
- test it right now ... 



agent to get jobs from different webistes and then say these are the jobs I want and then to auto apply and connects to resume writer ... 

Wants to: 
1. give the system the type of jobs I want to apply for, people apply to different tyeps of jobs 2-3-4-5 types of roles 
2. system will search website ABCD like linkedin, indeed, monster, etc. all those big job boards 
	1. retrieves information make sure no duplicates 
	2. brings into a central database
3. user will review it on daily basis, check mark 
	1. then will get job description and tailor the resume and cover letter and sent out to the user 

have you used any existing solution online? 
- Teal 
	- garbage -> paid $19 for it... 
	- very unfriendly to use .... 
	- it was only good for tracking and finding the jobs ... 
	- NEEDED the most: writing the resume, was the hardest though ...
		- not doing a good job of rewriting the resume 

Overall flow: 
First find it 
write resume / cover letter 
	- MOST PAINFUL PART she said 
	- after 10 minutes 300 people apply to it ... on LinkedIn 
actually going to website and applying for it (operator) 
	- least pain for me 

Other solution: 
- not work for corporate and start own company ... 

solo entreprenuer: 
inbound/outbound/chatbots 24k ... white label 
- ai solution for phone calls ... / inbound calls customer calling her client, if they miss that call ... 
- we use the ai to answer the phone calls ... can use ai to book the client still (but send a text message instead?)
- for scheduling / booking appointments / inbound / outbound, sending reminders for appointments / medical field validate insurance 
- trello/vapi have solutions for this ... inboudn outbound booking scheduling 
- vandesta (different solution) 
- ai arbitrage agency .... 
- make.com - ai automation software
