Has current job, looking for new jobs
Did automatic PR review bot 
And call center summarization and put on resume 
Phrased as the current job profile work ... 

Not hearing back for first couple months ... 
Just had call with non GenAI role ... for python 

Background: 
24 years 
Diverse job profile 
Procurement applications, experience with Java development, SAP development etc. doing production support AT&T applications 
More involved with operations, making sure everything runs fine 

2 projects -> Azure + Cassandra Elastic Search, maintain application, debugging of ticket / or yaml changes deployment working with development team, OS patching 
- Support for core fusions apps php/asp.net, 
- Operations Engineer 


PROBLEM: 
- no ai background 
- just the 2 projects from IK 
- want a job in ai 
	- ai/ml engineer 
	- prompt engineering 
		- haven't heard back 

Job search: 
1. Put job requirements and resume and use ChatGPT to tailor to get 85% ATS score 
	1. Tell ChatGPT I'm applying for job, copy job description, then also put resume with summary experiences, and ask if this is good fit for profile, and can you give ATS and other recommendations to change for this 
	2. ChatGPT does provide some recommendations, doesn't follow all, doesn't want to tweak towards making stuff up ... reframing certain sentences 
		1. ChatGPT for recommendations only, doesn't actually have it redo resume 
	3. It takes 45 minutes for each job ... also need a cover letter !!
	4. Applying seriously for a job 
	5. Used to use one resume for all and never got any replies 
		1. Then talked to people doing job search then came across this ATS check 
		2. Asking ChatGPT a ATS score and to provide some recommendations 
2. TIME is major issue bottleneck 
3. Entire process: 
	1. Has multiple sets of resumes for operations/support jobs and others for ai jobs ... 
	2. Looking everyday 2-3 jobs applying to 
4. So far only got a couple calls response .... 
	1. 2nd round interview then reach out but not ai ... 
5. Wants to know what else to do in her search process to maximize the job result response 
6. How confident feel when preparing resume, main focus no more than 2 pages, focusing more on summary of skills and first project
