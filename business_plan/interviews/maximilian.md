### Process

When first looking - applying online and LinkedIn - easy apply 
Learned easy apply - should look for recruiter and send them a message on linkedin somewhat improved results, yet sometimes they may not respond 
    - response rate easy apply is 1 response per 100 applications 

Reaching out to recruiters -> 1/10 or 1/20 response rate 
    - Would send: uses a template -> gives intro and what looking, and then asks for a connection 

Resume use: 
    - used to use same resume 
    - learned it's not ideal, must use resume that closely aligned with job description 
    - learned from IK to use tailored resume, from a career transformation coach 
    - learned more via the expert connect (recruiter) at IK 
        - Working at Meta -> Aileen Burckhardt - Amazon 
    - learned from Aileen (expert connect 20 minutes) 
        - put most impactful projects first 
        - ensure top 3 sectiosn capture recruiter attentino 
        - bridge employment gaps with current learning 
        - remove task driven descriptions, what accomplished rather than what had to do 
        - quantify achievements 
        - highlight unique technolgoies
        - create white space
        - use intentional bolding 
        - make resume easy to scan 
        - use consistent formatting 
        - out come focus 
    - what he did after ("Project Bridge") 
        - put ai project he did at top of his resume 
        - is a resume processing tool, skill gap analysis tool integrating ai powered skill extraction system 

How find companies to apply to? 
    - does a linked in search filter with boolean search ... 
    - click on company linkedin - go to people, thens people messages there 
    - recently looking for startups - messaging their recruiter, etc. asking about the company and their experience 
    - uses LinkedIn + Wellfound (prefers Series B+ for better work life balance) 

Uses "Raven" on WellFound - that sends jobs that are a match for you based on what you are looking for 
    - Tells you what you should add to your resume .. .
    - Mention following keyword or experiences etc. 
    - Can apply on the site or talk to the recruiter or engineer through Raven 

Also, using Indeed 
    - Look for "Indeed quick response jobs" 
    - Looking for recruiters who will respond quickly 

Motivation for Job Search? 
    - looking for stability (not constant layoffs) 
    - better work life balance 
    - can grow in role
    - stay for long time etc. (5 years)

Resume tailoring: 
    Will look at job description and then IK resume analysis based on a job description 
    And wants to get 85% or higher ... 
    If gives a lower score -> 
        - would give criticism on what need to do to tailore resume etc. 
        - gap analysis

His own resume analysis tool:
    1. v0.dev template from Vercel ... 
    2. Create a good prompt to be descriptive on how the app should work, considered using GPT to create the prompt etc. 
    3. v0.dev ai to create the website 
    4. seems primarily UI wrapper on single AI call
