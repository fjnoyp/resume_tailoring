You underestimate good ChatGPT prompts.

Here are the 17 golden rules of ChatGPT:

Start with a Role
  “Act like \[expert]” so ChatGPT adopts the right expertise and tone.

State Your Objective
  Skip “Hi” & “Thank you.” Begin with a concise mission.

Tell Who It’s For
  “Explain to someone who knows nothing about the topic.”

Use Positive, Direct Commands
  “List three reasons,” not “Don’t forget to avoid mistakes.”

Break Big Tasks into Steps
  Step 1: “Write an outline.”
  Step 2: “Fill in each point with details.”

Provide Clean Examples
  Show “input → output.” Keep them uniform and tightly focused on what you want.

Ask for the Format
  Tell it exactly how to structure: “Send a table with two columns.”

Choose Your “Shots”

Zero‑shot: “Translate to French.”
One‑shot: Provide one example.
Few‑shot: Supply 3–5 labeled examples separated by ###.

Set Simple Limits
  Limit length, style, or content: “No more than 100 words.”

Invoke Frameworks
  Tap AIDA, PAS, or your own frameworks: “Follow PAS model: Problem → Agitate → Solve.”

Provide Precise Feedback
  Point to the line or bullet: “In bullet # 2, add a statistic on market growth.”

Ask for Chain‑of‑Thought
  For transparency, request “Show your reasoning step by step,” or “Think aloud in bullet points.”

Skip Polite Words
  No need for “please” or “thank you.” Just say what you need.

Iterate on Your Prompts
  Compare variants. Use the one that performs best.

Repeat or Emphasize Key Points
  “Remember: brief, clear, and friendly.”

Try Different Wording
  Compare “Summarize X” vs. “Give me a quick recap of X.”

Use an Encouraging Cue
  “Take a deep breath, then walk through each step one at a time.”
