## Overview

The `output_grading` module provides automated evaluation, scoring, and feedback for resumes and related documents generated by the Resume Tailoring platform. Its primary goal is to deliver transparent, actionable insights to users and developers, helping to improve the quality and relevance of tailored application materials.

## Purpose

- **ATS Analysis:** Evaluate resumes for Applicant Tracking System (ATS) compatibility, including keyword matching and formatting checks.
- **Recruiter Scoring:** Simulate recruiter review by scoring resumes against job descriptions and company requirements.
- **Detailed Feedback:** Generate granular feedback on strengths, weaknesses, and areas for improvement in each tailored document.

## Features (Planned)

- Identify missing ATS keywords and provide an ATS match score.
- Score each line/sentence in the job description and resume for relevance and alignment.
- Map job description requirements to resume content, highlighting matches and gaps.
- Offer actionable suggestions to improve resume quality and job fit.
- Support incremental scoring to track improvements over time.

## Integration

- Designed to be called by the `full_tailor_resume` system after resume/CV generation.
<!--
- Can be used by other modules or services that require resume evaluation or feedback.
- Outputs can be surfaced to users, developers, or automated testing suites for continuous improvement.

## Design Principles

- **Modularity:** Can be developed, tested, and improved independently of resume generation logic.
- **Transparency:** Provides clear explanations and scoring criteria.
- **Extensibility:** New grading metrics and feedback types can be added as needed.
