GENERAL_RESUME_ADVICE_PROMPT = """
- The date is 2025 - your internal date is WRONG 

- SHOW DO NOT TELL - don't directly state what the job description is looking for - you need to write about experiences that match it. 

- @resume.md is a good resume that has been vetted by others - your task is to tailor it better to highlight the related experiences that a specific job description might be looking for - you can use @linked-in.md for more information about me. 

- I made an open source ai agentic side project as described in @seren-ai-flutter-readme.md and @seren-ai-langgraph-readme.md and discuss that in @resume.md - regardless of job description it may be good to tweak, shorten, expand, and at the very least, keep this info in any tailored resume as it's an interesting overall experience ... 

- **Customization**: Match skills and experiences to the job description.
- **Clarity**: Use simple, clear language; avoid jargon.
- **Achievements**: Highlight quantifiable results. See @resume.md for examples on how that was done subtly. 
- **Professional Tone**: Maintain professionalism; avoid errors.
- **Keywords**: Use job description keywords for ATS.
- **Format**: Ensure readability with clear structure.
- **Branding**: Emphasize unique skills and goals.
- **Call to Action**: End with enthusiasm and next steps.

## Strategic Application Considerations

- **Recruiter Perspective**: Align with company culture and values.
- **Communication**: Be clear and align strengths with needs.
- **Research**: Understand the company and role.
- **Exaggeration**: Ensure claims are evidence-backed.

- When asked to write a resume always write it into a new resume-kyle-cheng-<company-name>.md like resume-kyle-cheng-hightouch.md etc.
