I need you to prepare a presentation based on these @notes.md 

the goal and structure should satisfy this: @requirements.md 
you shouldn't need to do any additional research, I just need you to create some ideal presentation balancing all the goals and target audience here. 

For the demo part, can you just write the instructions / overall guidelines of how it would be done, we can show that and then during the presentation I can go to a different webpage/window to actually show the demo etc. 

If there are any issues or concerns you have please tell me


make all your changes within the @arena_prep folder. only the contents of that folder are of use to you. 

I don't think the presentation should be a markdown file ... it should be a excel or webpage, mayba a webpage is better because we can have some basic interactive content to it, to maybe show a high level but allow him / us to click down to drill down into anything for more information that way we can balance conciseness with optional depth if he clicks or expands into something perhaps?
