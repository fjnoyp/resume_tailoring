# Windows MCP Multi-Agent Workflow Demo
*Duration: 3-5 minutes*

## Pre-Meeting Setup

### Required Environment
- Windows 11 Insider Preview build (if available)
- OR: Windows 11 with MCP simulator/mockup
- Excel, Outlook, and time tracking app installed
- Sample employee hours data

### Fallback Option
- Pre-recorded video showing the workflow
- Screenshots of each step
- Mockup UI showing agent orchestration

## Live Demo Flow

### 1. Introduction (30 seconds)
"I'll demonstrate how Windows 11's new MCP protocol enables natural language commands to orchestrate multiple applications - turning hours of manual work into a single request."

### 2. The Natural Language Command (30 seconds)
Type in Windows search/Copilot:
```
"Prepare a performance summary from my team's tracked hours for Q2, 
create charts in Excel showing productivity trends, and email the 
report to Sarah in HR with next quarter's projections"
```

### 3. Show Agent Orchestration (2 minutes)
Display the agent workflow visualization:

```
┌─────────────────┐     ┌─────────────────┐     ┌─────────────────┐
│   Time Tracker  │────▶│      Excel      │────▶│     Outlook     │
│     Agent       │     │     Agent       │     │      Agent      │
└─────────────────┘     └─────────────────┘     └─────────────────┘
       │                         │                         │
       ▼                         ▼                         ▼
  Extract Data              Create Charts            Compose Email
  Calculate Stats           Format Report            Add Attachments
  Identify Trends          Add Projections           Set Recipients
```

### 4. Real-Time Execution (1-2 minutes)
Show (or simulate) each step:
- Time tracking app opens, data being extracted
- Excel launches, creating pivot tables and charts
- Outlook composing email with attachments
- Final preview before sending

### 5. Results (30 seconds)
- Show completed Excel report with charts
- Display draft email with attachments
- Emphasize: "3 minutes vs 2 hours of manual work"

## Key Talking Points

- **No coding required**: "Natural language to complex workflows"
- **Error handling**: "Agents communicate to resolve issues"
- **Security**: "Each app grants specific permissions"
- **Scale**: "230,000 organizations already building agents"

## Demo Variations

### Alternative Scenario 1: Sales Pipeline
```
"Pull this week's CRM data, analyze win rates by product, 
create a dashboard in Power BI, and schedule a Teams meeting 
with the sales team to review"
```

### Alternative Scenario 2: Financial Reporting
```
"Reconcile this month's invoices from QuickBooks with bank 
statements, flag discrepancies in Excel, and create an 
exception report for the CFO"
```
