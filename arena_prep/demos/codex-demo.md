# OpenAI Codex Demo Instructions

## Overview
This demo showcases OpenAI's Codex AI coding agent integrated within ChatGPT, demonstrating its capabilities compared to established competitors.

## Demo Setup (5 minutes)
1. Open ChatGPT with Pro/Enterprise subscription
2. Navigate to Codex feature in sidebar
3. Connect GitHub repository (if available)

## Demo Flow

### Part 1: Basic Code Generation (3 minutes)
1. **Simple Function Creation**
   - Prompt: "Create a Python function to analyze customer churn data"
   - Show how Codex generates code in sandboxed environment
   - Note the 1-30 minute execution time for complex tasks

### Part 2: Market Comparison (5 minutes)
1. **Show Competitor Landscape**
   - Display pricing comparison:
     - Codex: Requires ChatGPT Pro ($20/mo) + usage
     - Cursor: $20/mo with model flexibility
     - Windsurf: $15/mo or free tier
     - GitHub Copilot: $10/mo
   
2. **Model Lock-in Discussion**
   - Codex: OpenAI models only
   - Competitors: Support Claude, GPT-4, Gemini (model-agnostic)
   - Quote: "Everyone seems to still prefer Claude for coding"

### Part 3: Enterprise Limitations (5 minutes)
1. **Integration Challenges**
   - Codex: ChatGPT-only, no IDE integration
   - Competitors: VS Code, JetBrains, terminal integration
   
2. **Market Reality**
   - Show Cursor's $300M ARR vs Codex's late entry
   - Discuss OpenAI's $3B acquisition of Windsurf (ironic competitive dynamic)

## Key Talking Points
- **Late Market Entry**: Entering a mature market dominated by specialized tools
- **Limited Differentiation**: No unique features vs established players
- **Higher Total Cost**: ChatGPT Pro + Codex usage vs competitor flat rates
- **Developer Preference**: Model flexibility trumps vendor lock-in

## Investment Implications
1. **Market Saturation**: 7M developers already using AI coding tools
2. **Acquisition Activity**: OpenAI buying Windsurf shows build vs buy dynamics
3. **Model Provider Strategy**: Better to be "arms dealer" than tool maker
4. **Future Consolidation**: Expect more M&A as market matures

## Demo Conclusion (2 minutes)
- Codex represents OpenAI's attempt to capture coding assistant market share
- Success unlikely without significant differentiation or pricing advantage
- Market has spoken: developers want model choice, not vendor lock-in
- Investment focus should be on model providers (Anthropic, OpenAI) or acquisition targets (Cursor, Replit)
