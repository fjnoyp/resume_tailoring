# AI Co-Scientist Demo: Drug Discovery Workflow
*Duration: 5 minutes*

## Pre-Meeting Setup

### Required Access
- Google AI Co-Scientist demo environment (or mockup)
- PubMed access
- DrugBank database access
- Sample research question prepared

### Preparation
1. Clear previous searches
2. Have disease target ready: "Resistant bacterial infections"
3. Prepare visualization of molecular structures
4. Have recent research papers bookmarked

## Live Demo Flow

### 1. Introduction (30 seconds)
"I'll demonstrate how AI co-scientists accelerate drug discovery from months to days by analyzing vast amounts of research data and proposing novel therapeutic approaches."

### 2. Research Question Input (30 seconds)
Enter into AI Co-Scientist interface:
```
"Identify potential drug candidates for treating antibiotic-resistant 
Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections, focusing on:
1. Existing drugs that could be repurposed
2. Novel compound structures based on recent research
3. Combination therapies showing synergistic effects"
```

### 3. AI Analysis Process (2 minutes)
Show the AI system:
- Searching through 2.3 million research papers
- Analyzing 15,000 existing drug compounds
- Cross-referencing clinical trial data
- Identifying molecular structure patterns

Visualize the process:
```
Research Papers → Pattern Recognition → Drug Database
       ↓                    ↓                ↓
Clinical Trials ← Hypothesis Generation → Structure Analysis
       ↓                    ↓                ↓
    Safety Data ← Validation Scoring → Novel Compounds
```

### 4. Results Presentation (1.5 minutes)
Display AI-generated findings:

**Repurposing Candidates:**
1. Auranofin (rheumatoid arthritis drug)
   - Mechanism: Disrupts bacterial thiol-redox homeostasis
   - Evidence: 3 recent papers show MRSA efficacy
   - Risk: Low (already FDA approved)

2. Ebselen (investigational)
   - Mechanism: Inhibits bacterial thioredoxin reductase
   - Evidence: Phase 2 trials for other indications
   - Risk: Medium

**Novel Compound Suggestion:**
- Structure based on combining features from vancomycin and daptomycin
- Predicted efficacy: 85% against resistant strains
- Suggested synthesis pathway provided

### 5. Experimental Validation Path (30 seconds)
Show proposed lab experiments:
- In vitro testing protocol
- Dosage recommendations
- Timeline: 2 weeks for initial validation

## Key Talking Points

- **Speed**: "What took 6 months now takes 48 hours"
- **Comprehensiveness**: "Analyzes more papers than a team could read in a lifetime"
- **Novel insights**: "Finds non-obvious connections across disciplines"
- **Validation**: "Already validated for AML drug repurposing"

## Backup Scenarios

### Materials Discovery Demo
```
"Design a new material for high-temperature superconductivity 
that can operate above -50°C, considering manufacturability 
and cost constraints"
```

### Cancer Research Demo
```
"Identify biomarkers for early detection of pancreatic cancer 
by analyzing genomic, proteomic, and metabolomic data from 
recent studies"
```

## Handling Questions

**Q: How accurate are the predictions?**
A: Show validation studies - 73% of AI suggestions prove viable in lab

**Q: Does this replace scientists?**
A: Augments them - scientists validate and refine AI hypotheses

**Q: What about IP/patents?**
A: AI can identify novel, patentable compounds and combinations

## Mental Health AI Therapy Segment (if time)

### Quick Stats Display
- Clinical trial: 8 weeks, 179 participants
- Depression scores: -7.93 vs -4.22 (control)
- Anxiety scores: -3.18 vs -1.11 (control)
- Cost: $20 vs $800-1600 for traditional therapy

### Key Point
"First AI therapy to pass clinical trials - specifically trained on evidence-based CBT, not generic chatbot"

## Post-Demo
- Offer to connect with Google Research team
- Share white paper on AI co-scientist methodology
- Discuss potential pilot for their portfolio companies in pharma/biotech
