### Part 2: Gemini 2.5 vs Competition (5 minutes)
1. **Performance Comparison**
   - Show leaderboard: Gemini 2.5 Pro leads WebDev Arena
   - Demo: Same coding task in Gemini vs Claude vs GPT-4

   - 2.5 Flash: Free in Gemini app
   
2. **Pricing Comparison**

   - ChatGPT Plus: $20/mo
   - Claude Pro: $20/mo
   - Analysis: "Google going for market share over revenue"

### Part 4: Enterprise Reality Check (2 minutes)
1. **Developer Adoption**
   - 7 million developers (5x growth)
   - Vertex AI usage up 40x
   - BUT: Show Cursor/Windsurf market share still growing faster

2. **MCP Integration**
   - Gemini now supports Model Context Protocol
   - Demo: Same Windows 11 agent working with Gemini API
   - Point: "Google playing catch-up on standards"

## Key Talking Points
- **Breadth vs Depth**: Google announced 100+ features; OpenAI focused on one (Codex)
- **Free Strategy**: Google giving away what others charge for - classic market domination play
- **Consumer vs Enterprise**: 400M MAU on Gemini app, but enterprises prefer specialized tools
- **Token Scale**: Processing more tokens than all competitors combined - but quality > quantity

## Investment Implications
1. **Platform Play**: Google betting on ubiquity across all surfaces
2. **Monetization Timeline**: Capturing market share now, monetize later
3. **Competitive Response**: Forcing competitors to lower prices or differentiate
4. **Risk**: Spreading too thin vs focused players like Anthropic

## Demo Conclusion (1 minute)
- Google's approach: "Be everywhere, be free (for now)"
- Works for consumers (400M MAU), questionable for enterprise
- Investment thesis: Bet on focused players for enterprise, Google for consumer
- Watch for: When free tier limits tighten as market matures
