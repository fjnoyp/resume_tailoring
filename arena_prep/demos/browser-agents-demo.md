## Key Talking Points

- **Reliability**: "95%+ success rate vs 60-70% last year"
- **Authentication**: "Handles login flows automatically"
- **Error Recovery**: "Watch how it retries when a page doesn't load"
- **Cost**: "$20/month unlimited vs OpenAI's $200+ tier"

## Alternative Demos

### Invoice Processing
```
"Download all invoices from our vendor portal for May 2025, 
extract the amounts and due dates, and create a payment 
schedule in order of due date."
```

### Lead Generation
```
"Search LinkedIn for 'VP of Engineering' at companies with 
100-500 employees in the San Francisco Bay Area. Compile 
their names, companies, and any listed email addresses."
```

## Handling Demo Failures

1. **Site changes layout**: "This shows why visual recognition is key - the agent adapts"
2. **Login required**: Show how agent handles authentication
3. **Rate limiting**: "In production, agents respect rate limits automatically"
4. **Network issues**: Switch to backup video

## Competitive Comparison Points

- **Convergence.ai**: Best price/performance, UK startup
- **OpenAI Operator**: More expensive, better for creative tasks
- **AskUI**: Best for desktop automation beyond browser
- **Skyvern**: Specialized for forms and data entry

## Questions to Anticipate

A: Current agents pause for human intervention on CAPTCHAs

**Q: Is our data secure?**
A: Runs in isolated browser environments, no data retention

**Q: Can it work with our internal tools?**
A: Yes, any web-based application can be automated
