- Merge the provided INFORMATION TO ADD (markdown) into the current content of the full resume at FULL RESUME FILE PATH (also markdown) (if the file exists).
- Only add new, non-duplicate information; do not remove or replace existing content.
- The result must be a complete, well-structured markdown resume, using proper markdown formatting for all sections.
- When calling the upload_file_to_bucket tool, the file_content parameter must be the full, updated markdown resume. Do not pass a summary, description, or explanation â€” only the actual file content.
- If the file does not exist, create it with properly formatted markdown content.
- **The file_content parameter for the upload must ALWAYS be the full, updated markdown resume.**

- After uploading the file, respond with a concise answer explaining what was added and that you have updated/created the FULL RESUME FILE PATH.
- If some of your tool calls fail, respond with a concise answer explaining what happened.
